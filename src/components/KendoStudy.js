        <h2>Shikai - The Four Sicknesses of Kendo</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Mushin or empty mind is our ultimate goal in kendo we need this in order to achieve ippon but this mind state however, cannot be met if we suffer one or more of the sicknesses in kendo.
            So what are they? Understanding the four sicknesses and what they are can help us to grow stronger, we've all experienced them but could we pinpoint exactly what was going on at the time? Would we be able to categorise them in the heat of keiko/shiai? Maybe not but below is a summary.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Fear</h3>
        <p>Either you fear someone is stronger than you or worst of all you fear losing to your opponent (ego). Because of this fear you can actually defeat yourself.</p>
        <h3>Surprise</h3>
        <p>When someone breaks your mental composure or kamae you are open to attack. Either through seme or sometimes a Katsugi waza you will be off guard and exposed.</p>
        <h3>Doubt</h3>
        <p>You are unsure so you either attack without purpose or don't attack at all. How can you make ippon? You certainly won't have the full spirit to do so.</p>
        <h3>Hesitation</h3>
        <p>You lack commitment, you stop to think what might have been within a microsecond you know the chance has gone. Lost chance means more chance for your opponent and again how can you make ippon in this mind state?</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>How to overcome?</h2>
        <p>Kakarigeiko - the harder the better, a big sensei will extinguish these fears quickly it seems tough at the time but actually you grow strong and stay calm.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Keiko - do as much as possible. The sicknesses are a sign you are not doing enough</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Be honest with yourself - Why did I do that? Why was I shocked, think why did I feel fear was the real reason I was scared of losing? Analyse but don't get hung up on it. Kendo is for life. Always follow a strong experienced Sensei they have been through all what you are experiencing they can guide you. Never stop enjoying kendo it's the challenge that makes it so enjoyable</p>
